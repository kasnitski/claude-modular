# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** [Your Project Name]
**Technology Stack:** [List main technologies - e.g., React, Node.js, PostgreSQL]
**Architecture:** [Brief description - e.g., Microservices, Monolithic, JAMstack]

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Code Quality Standards
- **Immutable Rule:** All code must pass linting and type checking before commit
- **Testing Required:** Minimum 80% test coverage for new features
- **Documentation:** All public APIs must be documented
- **Security:** Never commit secrets, always use environment variables

### 2. Modular Command Structure
This project uses the Claude Code modular command system for consistent workflows:
- Commands are organized in `.claude/commands/` by category
- Each command follows XML-structured format for clarity
- Use `/[category]:[command]` syntax for execution
- Commands are environment-aware and security-focused

### 3. Emergency Procedures
- **Build Failures:** Run `/dev:debug-session` for systematic troubleshooting
- **Test Failures:** Use `/test:coverage-analysis` to identify issues
- **Deployment Issues:** Execute `/deploy:rollback-procedure` for emergency rollback
- **Security Concerns:** Immediately run security scans and notify team

## Command Categories

### Project Management
- `/project:create-feature` - Full feature development with tests and docs
- `/project:scaffold-component` - Component creation with boilerplate
- `/project:setup-environment` - Development environment initialization

### Development Workflow

- `/deploy:deploy-staging` - Staging deployment with validation
- `/deploy:rollback-procedure` - Emergency rollback execution

### Documentation
- `/docs:api-docs` - API documentation generation
- `/docs:update-readme` - README maintenance and updates
- `/docs:architecture-review` - Architecture documentation and review

## Project-Specific Commands

### Build and Development

# or
yarn build

# Run tests
npm test
# or
yarn test

# Run linting
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint

# Type checking
npm run type-check
# or
yarn type-check
```

## Architecture Notes

### Key Components
- **[Component 1]:** [Brief description and location]
- **[Component 2]:** [Brief description and location]
- **[Component 3]:** [Brief description and location]

### Data Flow
[Describe how data flows through your system]

### External Dependencies
- **[Service 1]:** [Purpose and integration notes]
- **[Service 2]:** [Purpose and integration notes]

### Security Considerations
- Authentication: [Describe your auth system]
- Authorization: [Describe your permission system]
- Data Protection: [Describe your data handling]

## Quality Gates

### Pre-commit Requirements
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Code coverage maintained

### Pre-deployment Requirements
- [ ] All quality gates pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Migration scripts tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security review complete

## Token Management

### Context Optimization
- Use progressive disclosure for large codebases
- Load commands just-in-time based on current task
- Clear context when switching between major tasks
- Monitor token usage and optimize accordingly

### Memory Management
- Leverage MCP memory server for session continuity
- Store architectural decisions in external documentation
- Use modular instructions to reduce token overhead
- Implement context compression for repeated patterns

## Team Conventions

### Git Workflow
- **Branch Naming:** `feat/feature-name`, `fix/bug-name`, `docs/doc-name`
- **Commit Messages:** Follow conventional commits format
- **Pull Requests:** Require review and all checks passing
- **Merging:** Squash commits for clean history

### Code Review Process
- Use `/dev:code-review` for automated analysis
- Focus on security, performance, and maintainability
- Require documentation for public APIs
- Ensure test coverage for new features

### Release Process
- Use `/deploy:prepare-release` for release preparation
- Follow semantic versioning
- Generate changelog automatically
- Deploy to staging first, then production

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required environment variables
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
API_KEY=your-api-key
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret

# Optional environment variables
LOG_LEVEL=info
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```
