## üèóÔ∏è Command Development Guidelines

### Command Structure

All commands must follow the XML-structured format:

```xml
<instructions>
  <context>
    Brief description of when and why to use this command
  </context>
  
  <requirements>
    - Specific prerequisites and dependencies
    - Required file structures or tools
    - Environment setup needs
  </requirements>
  
  <execution>
    Step-by-step implementation with verification points
  </execution>
  
  <validation>
    Quality checks and acceptance criteria
  </validation>
  
  <examples>
    Concrete usage examples with expected outputs
  </examples>
</instructions>
```

### Command Categories

Commands are organized into these categories:

- **project/** - Project management and scaffolding
- **development/** - Development workflow and code quality
- **testing/** - Test generation and validation
- **deployment/** - Deployment and operations
- **documentation/** - Documentation generation and maintenance

### Naming Conventions

- **File names**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `create-feature.md`)
- **Command names**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `/project:create-feature`)
- **Categories**: Use singular nouns (e.g., `project`, not `projects`)

### Command Requirements

Each command must include:

1. **Clear context** - When and why to use the command
2. **Prerequisites** - What needs to be set up first
3. **Step-by-step execution** - Detailed implementation steps
4. **Validation criteria** - How to verify success
5. **Realistic examples** - Working examples with expected outputs
6. **Error handling** - Common issues and solutions

## üìù Documentation Guidelines

### Writing Style

- **Clear and concise** - Avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Action-oriented** - Use imperative voice
- **Consistent terminology** - Use the same terms throughout
- **Inclusive language** - Avoid assumptions about reader background

### Documentation Structure

- **Overview** - Brief description of purpose
- **Prerequisites** - What readers need to know/have
- **Step-by-step instructions** - Clear, numbered steps
- **Examples** - Real-world usage scenarios
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

### Code Examples

- **Working examples** - Test all code examples
- **Multiple scenarios** - Show different use cases
- **Expected outputs** - Show what users should see
- **Error cases** - Include error handling examples

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Command Testing

Before submitting a command, test it with:

1. **Fresh environment** - Test on clean setup
2. **Multiple scenarios** - Test different use cases
3. **Error conditions** - Test failure scenarios
